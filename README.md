# PHP Recursive Function and String Manipulation Bug

This repository demonstrates a potential bug in PHP code involving recursive functions and string manipulation within nested arrays. The original code has an issue where recursive calls don't correctly handle edge cases and potential infinite loops. The solution provides a fix to ensure safe processing of the nested array regardless of its structure or content.

## Bug Description

The original PHP code attempts to process nested array data and modify specific strings.  However, it lacks robust checks to handle edge cases such as deeply nested arrays or arrays containing circular references, which may lead to unexpected behavior or infinite recursion.

## Solution

The solution enhances the recursive function with more robust checks and error handling to prevent infinite loops or unexpected behavior.
